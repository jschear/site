I’ve built and thrown away more personal blogs than I’ve written blog posts. Maybe this time will be different!

### Tech stack
This blog is a lightly-customized clone of the [Astro blog template](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/latest/examples/blog?on=github) and is hosted and deployed using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/dashboard). I may later manage content with a headless CMS, but at the moment I’m authoring posts in markdown (or [mdx](https://mdxjs.com/)) and using Astro’s static site generation.

I find the abundance of full-stack web frameworks to be both overwhelming and exciting (especially coming from mobile development). I’m heartened by the industry-wide adoption of [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) because I’m not sure how to be productive in the long term when using dynamically-typed languages.

After puttering around with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Remix](https://remix.run/), and a few other frameworks (meta-frameworks?), I decided to move forward with [Astro](https://astro.build/), which I learned about on an episode of the [devtools.fm podcast](https://devtools.fm/episode/14). This wasn't a particularly well-considered decision; I mainly just wanted to throw something online. (This was a case of vibe-driven-development.) [htmx](https://htmx.org/) and [fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/) are also on my list of web technologies to explore.

The blog’s title comes from one of my favorite Unicode codepoints, the [zero width joiner (U+200D)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-width_joiner).
