I'm working on an [iOS app](/notes/2023-05-30-ios-focus/).

I recently finished a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com). (If you like to program, I highly recommend applying!) I used my time there to explore a broad set of topics:
- Functional programming
- Programming languages
- Declarative UI frameworks, incremental computation
- Self-adjusting computation, build systems
- Conflict-free replicated data types
- Audio/DSP programming
- WebGL (via three.js)

I also focused on getting productive with a few specific technologies:
- OCaml
- Rust
- Nix

I'm playing Tears of the Kingdom (and probably will be for the next year), and reading [Quarterlife](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/579928/quarterlife-by-satya-doyle-byock/).

I'm paddling at the [Mongaup](https://kccny.org/locations/mongaup-river/).
