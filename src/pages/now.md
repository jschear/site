I'm attending a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com). I'm exploring a few different topics, including:
- Functional programming
- Programming languages
- Declarative UI frameworks, incremental computation
- Self-adjusting computation, build systems
- Confict-free replicated data types
- Audio/DSP programming
- WebGL (via three.js)

Tactically, I'm working on getting productive with:
- OCaml
- Rust
- Nix

I'm playing [Dredge](https://www.dredge.game/), and reading [Quarterlife](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/579928/quarterlife-by-satya-doyle-byock/).
