I recently finished a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com). (If you like to program, I highly recommend applying!) I used my time there to explore a broad set of topics I've been curious about:
- Functional programming
- Programming languages
- Declarative UI frameworks, incremental computation
- Self-adjusting computation, build systems
- Confict-free replicated data types
- Audio/DSP programming
- WebGL (via three.js)

I also focused on getting productive with a few specific technologies:
- OCaml
- Rust
- Nix

I'm playing Tears of the Kingdom (and probably will be for the next year...), and reading [Quarterlife](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/579928/quarterlife-by-satya-doyle-byock/) and [Thinking in Systems](https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/CpbLAgAAQBAJ?hl=en).
